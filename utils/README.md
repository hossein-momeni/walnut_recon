# Ground truth data reconstruction

Data in the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) Walnut Dataset are provided in the form of multiple X-ray projections from three different viewing angles. Code for reconstructing ground truth volumes from these three views are provided in the [authors' original code](https://github.com/cicwi/WalnutReconstructionCodes). We repurpose this code (released under the MIT License) to save reconstructed volumes for each walnut as NIfTI images.
